## SAW (Sviluppo Applicazioni Web) Course Project

**GeCar** is a web application developed as a part of the SAW (Sviluppo Applicazioni Web) course. The aim of this project was to create a fully functional car dealer website.

### Features

In this website, users can:
- **Buy cars**  
- **Download or delete invoices**  
- **Manage user bans or deletions**  
- And other simple but well-implemented functionalities...

### User Roles

There are three types of users in the system:

1. **Admin**: Complete access to the admin page.
2. **Editor**: Can insert, update, or delete cars.
3. **Normal User**: Has only read permissions.

### Learn More

If you want to learn more about the project, I have created a presentation that explains the database structure and the main functionalities of the website.

### Feedback

I would really appreciate any comments or suggestions for improvement (please, be kind ðŸ˜Š). Feel free to contact me!
